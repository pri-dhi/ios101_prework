## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

My favorite applications are Spotify, Gmail, and Photos. Some features that make them my favorite apps are the queuing feature in Spotify, the ability to mark emails as starred, read, and unread in Gmail, and the ability to organize my photos into albums in the Photos app.

An app idea that I would like to build would be a way to keep track of a grocery list, as well as a list of the ingredients that I already have at home. This would send me reminders to use my ingredients soon if they are reaching their expiration date and streamline my trips to the grocery store. It would allow me to save past foods so the app will remember what I usually buy and not require that I retype the food data again into the app. I would also be able to save my favorite recipes and check if I have the ingredients to make them, as well as get recommendations of what else I can cook with my ingredients. At the grocery store, I would be able to sort by ingredient type so that I can get all the groceries I need while I am in that section of the grocery store. Overall, the purpose of this app would be to optimize getting as much out of your groceries as possible and making cooking a simpler process.

## Notes

Some challenges I faced while working on this project were navigating the Xcode interface since I am unfamiliar with it.
